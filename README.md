Ajaxial is a single-file web library that embeds AJAX instructions directly in your HTML structure, allowing you to painlessly design client-server interactions without ever touching JavaScript yourself. With AJAX at your fingertips, the web becomes more powerful than all of Greece!

```html
<!-- A form like this... -->
<form ajxl-path="/subscribe" ajxl-method="post" ajxl-swap="outerHTML">
  <input type="email" name="email" required />
  <button type="submit">Subscribe!</button>
</form>

<!-- ...can turn into this when submitted! -->
<p>Thank you for subscribing!</p>
